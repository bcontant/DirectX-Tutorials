Exercices:

- Try playing around with the viewport dimensions.  Can you make the triangle render in the upper left quadrant of the window / backbuffer?

- Try playing around with the pixel shader.  Can you change its output color to green?  Can you add alpha to it?  (Alpha won't work, we'll look at why next!)

- Try adding a color member to the Vertex Structure and try to handle it all the way down to the pixel shader (we'll cover this soon)
