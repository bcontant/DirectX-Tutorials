## Tutorial 3

#### Create basic HLSL vertex and pixel shaders

#### Add the shaders to the project and set them to compile and create header files using the HLSL compiler

#### Load the compiled shaders at runtime and create the basic vertex and pixel shader

#### Create a VertexBuffer and fill it with a basic triangle

#### Create the InputLayout which will map the VertexBuffer to the VertexShader Inputs

#### Create a Viewport to determine the region of the BackBuffer that you want to target

#### Draw the VertexBuffer to the screen
